Hi there! I am Obryan Poyser Calderón, during the past years I've been part of data-driven solutions for start-ups, multinational companies, and public and NGO institutions. Having a hybrid perspective from research/academia and private sector roles, allowed me to develop a detail-oriented mindset aiming for actions that add business value while being fast and anticipating future events. My areas of expertise involve Time Series Forecast and Inference, Machine Learning, and Econometrics.
