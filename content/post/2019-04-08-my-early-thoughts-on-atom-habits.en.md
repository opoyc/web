The past weekend I started to read Atomic Habits by James Clear, it has been quite nice so far, but I mean, after checking out several articles on behavior-related issues and decision making, there is little margin for a surprise. Nonetheless, there is one thing I believe the author did it right, which simplifies concepts (not entirely an easy task).

```{r out.extra='style="float: left; height: 200px"', echo=F}

```

Among the first ideas James Clear try to convince the reader is to forget about the goals and concentrate the effort on what he called *system*, which is nothing else than a set of articulated intermediate goals whatsoever, but in the end, goals...

I am aware of the need to use or (re)create new concepts since *sophisticated* readers might think there is no reason to read a book which statements are just rephrasing of old books. For instance, the feedback loop of habits' modification is given as:

$$
cue \to craving \to response \to reward \to cue \to \dots
$$

My cringe moment occurred when I read what is *craving*, defined as *"the motivational force behind every habit"*, hmm well those are the old *desires*? Come on... Not a big deal, maybe today I just too judgemental.
